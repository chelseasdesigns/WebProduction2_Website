            <p><a href="poemProject\index.html">Here</a>'s my attempt at tackling the poem generator assignment; 
                I decided to take some of The Weeknd's popular lyrics and put them in the generator, most of which are of
                him missing his lover's touch, warmth, eyes, etc.
            I want to revisit this project later on in the future just to perfect the way it looks and fits with my website.</p>

            <p>Click Project 1's link to access my poem project! I worked with p5 and although it was a nice to work with it again after winter break, the only problem I
                had was linking the library to my actual project; I am thinking about making the heart beat with CSS animations once I figure out how to link it to the poem.

            <p>I decided to do my midterm based off of one of my favorite video games: VALORANT. Working with this API was challenging at first because the information was organized in
                a weird way but I quickly got the hang of it. I also worked with a new grid style that I wish I had more time to elaborate on but it ended up looking really cool! Lastly,
                I wanted to include some graphics and SVG files onto this project, but with the limited time we had I couldn't, I will come back to this project in the future though so it
                is more polished!
